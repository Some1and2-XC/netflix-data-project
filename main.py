The reshaping that takes place is in the `get_comma_values()` function.
What this function does is it splits the values by comma and just returns a 1D array of the output.
This function also applies a function to a specific column. 
The `answer_questions()` function does the "splitting data into groups based on some criteria",
this function splices the dataframe to get answers to questions.
